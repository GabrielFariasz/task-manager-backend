# Repo to practice SOLID and Clean Architecture

## ts-configs

Downloaded from a general purpose private repository =)

I'm trying to learn good practices, so this project
contain the following itens:

- Eslint, with js-standard
- Husky + git-commit-msg-linter- to ensure good commit messages
- Jest to use TDD process
- Typescript, to practice SOLID and Clean Architecture
- Only English in project ( this is not a tech related stuff, but how can I improve my english without use in fact? =) )

Feel free to send me a message: gabrielfarias@protonmail.com =)
